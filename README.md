# Practical Deep Learning

This repository documents my personal journey into **practical deep learning**.  
It contains hands-on notebooks, experiments, and notes as I learn and apply deep learning concepts through practice.

## What you’ll find
- Jupyter notebooks with experiments and exercises  
- Practical implementations inspired by real-world use cases  
- Notes and trials while learning deep learning tools and frameworks  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is not perfection, but **learning by doing**:
- understanding concepts through experimentation  
- making mistakes and improving over time  
- building intuition around deep learning workflows

## Dataset

This repository uses the **Microsoft Cats vs Dogs Dataset**.

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Microsoft Cats vs Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset)
* **Data for:** Cat and Dog categories.

> **Note:** This dataset is known to contain some corrupted images (e.g., `666.jpg` and `11702.jpg`) and non-image files (`Thumbs.db`).

This repo reflects my progress step by step as I grow my skills in deep learning.
